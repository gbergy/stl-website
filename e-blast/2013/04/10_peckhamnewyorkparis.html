      <br /><em>PECKHAMNEWYORKPARIS</em><br /><br />
      </h1>
      April 25 - May 4, 2013<br /><br />
      Opening reception: Thursday April 25, 6-8pm<br /><br />
          <br />
          Seven Peckham-based artists:<br />
<br />
<strong>James Balmforth (born 1980) </strong><br /> 
Balmforth’s sculptures are self-defeating monuments; icons of failure. The work exhibited here extends the artist’s intervention into the lives and functions of objects and materials. A dagger, associated with the power to take another life, harbors a hidden vulnerability to that which it is designed to attack. The dagger's blade is cast from Gallium, a metal that melts on contact with skin, therefore undermining the object's symbolic power and creating a new relationship to the body based on mutual influence. The use of Gallium introduces a significant theme in Balmforth’s work; the hidden life of matter, its secret complexities and failures.  
Recent exhibitions include I heart 3D! (Christies, London 2012), Sculpture al Fresco II 
(Marcelle Joseph Projects at Great Fosters, Egham 2012), Forthcoming; New Order - British Art Today (Saatchi Gallery, London 2013). Lives and works in Peckham, London. 
 <br /><br />
 <strong>James Capper (born 1987) </strong><br />
Capper makes drawings, maquettes and machines. Mechanical processes are central to 
Capper’s work and he is interested in the innovations of early engineering. Capper is inspired by the contributions made to engineering by prolific inventor Robert Gilmour Le Tourneau (1888–1969).  
Recent exhibitions include Hydraulic Power Tools (The Armory Show New York with Hannah Barry Gallery, 2013), YES - Young English Sculptors (Fundaziun Not Vital, Ardez, Switzerland, 2012). Forthcoming; New Order - British Art Today (Saatchi Gallery, London 2013). Lives and works in South-East London.
 <br /><br />
 <strong>Nathan Cash Davidson (born 1988) </strong><br />
Cash Davidson is an artist and lyricist. He makes paintings featuring diverse figures such as 
King Henry VIII, Mr. Punch, George Bush and Ali G. Characters from historical and popular culture, as well as the artist’s own family members meld with animated gargoyles and mournful mythological creatures in otherworldly forests, cathedrals, desert islands and council estates.  
Recent exhibitions include Burlesque in which we've thrown it on its head (solo, Parasol Unit, London 2010/2011). Forthcoming: New Order - British Art Today (Saatchi Gallery, London, 2013), Painter’s Painters (Saatchi Gallery, London, 2013). Lives and works in Peckham, 
London.  
 <br /><br />
 <strong>Bobby Dowler (born 1983) </strong><br />
Dowler deconstructs canvases and stretcher frames in order to reform them with accumulated tools and materials. These procedures stimulate unconventional decisions and techniques, helping to guide a work towards an eventual completion.  
Recent exhibitions include For Mad Men Only! (two-person, Hannah Barry Gallery, London 2013). Forthcoming: two-person show in the New Talent section, Art Brussels (2013). Lives and works in Peckham, London.
<br /><br />
<strong>Christopher Green (born 1983)</strong><br />  
Green makes paintings informed by revision and reinterpretation; the experience of living in the world and working in the studio. The finished works; left open - and ambiguous in the process of their creation - are worked on without regard for 'a whole' or in accordance with any singular, fixed statement of intent. He is co-founder of the Library of Independent Exchange (www.l-i-e.co.uk), a roving arts reference library and events space. 
Recent exhibitions include For Mad Men Only! (two-person, Hannah Barry Gallery, London 2013), Confidantes (solo, Hannah Barry Gallery, London 2012). Forthcoming: two-person show in the New Talent section, Art Brussels (2013). Lives and works in Peckham, London. 
<br /><br /> 
<strong>Oliver Griffin (born 1983)</strong><br /> 
Griffin’s archive of work includes the psycho-geographical observation and documentation of the environment experienced by the photographer. Griffin scavenges his own everyday life for used objects and remnants, and then rigorously catalogues them.  
Recent exhibitions include The Oliver Griffin Archive (solo, London Art Fair with Hannah Barry Gallery, 2013), ES9 (solo, Hannah Barry Gallery, London 2011), Exercises in Failure (curator, Son Gallery, London 2011). Lives and works in South-East London.
<br /><br /> 
<strong>Shaun McDowell (born 1981)</strong><br />  
McDowell is a sensual mark maker and colourist. Although McDowell's paintings may at times be inspired by a model or a landscape, in their appearance, his apparently abstract paintings offer little to no context or reference outside the sensuality or immediate experience of viewing the artworks themselves. Recent exhibitions include Nothing Fixed (curator, Marcelle Joseph Projects, London 2011) The Souvenir (solo, Hannah Barry Gallery, London 2012). Shaun McDowell lives and works in and around Peckham, London.
