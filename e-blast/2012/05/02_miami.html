Foerster wrote:<br />
&quot;hmmm, i just got to studio to go through some work for it. its going to be a mix of printing plates, probably ones from the garden, some found metal that look like printing plates. some photos ... probably compost ones and b&amp;w of the garden here. i have a few photos on the roof that i mounted on some found metal I'm hoping work out. i think the plates will look good because you can see both sides if i wedge them in between things or have them up against the fence or in the tree. probably some photograms that are those designs on the window bars. i think if i walk around there i should be able to find some good stuff for it ... maybe some wood to put photos on. i'll probably bring a few things from other walks I've gone on in other places that could look like they were already there. maybe some of the 'slag' rocks i have. i'll just bring more then enough and edit. some of the work i guess will be getting made during the course of the show or changing, which is exciting. was just looking at the google map of it. i like those pavement patches that are there also. I'm off to see that bill bollinger show. i went to the one last night really cool casts of the ground.”<br />
